  "description": "Would you call me an engineer or editor in chief of a magazine?\n\nBecoming interested in magazine writing, she as an engineering student, was asked to answer owing to the personal opinion relevant to the current social issues in Thailand. Since the unprecedented question  brings up, she becomes interested more issues occurred in Thailand. She notices one of the significant issues that there is no serious action responsive to the voice of students; therefore, she becomes interested in being a part of educational system transformers. Another way to express her thought if the voice of hers, and others, are not heard is to create own space of thoughts and make a magazine, which is freely distributed to students.ï¿½Since the first magazine has been published, there are more interested students who want to share their thoughts through the magazine for the second and the third editions of magazine.",
