  "description": "Currently, the cell sheet engineering is one of the most dynamic and large-scaled researches which will later have a major impact on both the patient’s treatment methods and the medical treatment costs. In recent years, cell sheet engineering has received much attention as a new approach to cure cartilage defects in the knees without the use of scaffold. Assoc. Prof. Kwanchanok, and a dynamic researcher team, introduce the technology which promises to help lessen pain, as well as, the costs by replacing the traditional medical treatment, the titanium scaffold insertion, with the new technology. The new method will require the cell sheet to be transplanted directly onto the damaged cartilage which will gradually grow and restore its damaged predecessor allowing the patient to resume their usual life.",
