  "description": "Global warming, pollutions, and wastes are problems that sound familiar to us, that concern us, that we think should be acted upon but are yet often thought as someone else’s doing. Hence we are where we are and the problems remain, and this cannot go on before it became unsustainable to the planet. Dr. Weerachat is here to share his experience of how we could all change that, by ourselves -  starting from simple things, things that he had tried and how they made an impact on the environment. If we are aware, if we are determined, if we want, we could do our bits to save the planet, it is easier than you think, “The world will move when you act”",
